## Summary
Whilst this app may seem simple, it's one of the biggest challenges I had to face. It is unique becuase everything is connected. Every number, every operator you click can affect the other, and that what makes this app difficult to create.

I hope you will enjoy the final product just as much as I was content with finishing it. Who would have known playing with a calculator can be so much fun?
